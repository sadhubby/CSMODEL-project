    "The structure of the dataset is quite simple. There exists 1994 observations or rows and there are 15 variables or columns. Each row is an entire set of information of a song, from its title and its artist, to its popularity. Each column represents a certain variable to be discussed further after this section. The only column that has no significance in the dataset is the index column attached with the dataset as to say that the index has no real merit in ranking the song. "
